Etersoft EPM package manager README

Really, EPM is a wrapper for any package manager used in your operating system.

Run $ epm --help for check all support commands.

The main goal of the project â€” provide the same package management interface
on any platform.

You can use
# epmi NAME
or
# epm -i NAME
or
# epm install NAME
for install package. It is just aliases for one command: install of the package.
EEPM will run urpmi on Mandriva, apt-get install on Ubuntu, yum install on Fedora.
And it have a little intelligence, so EEPM will try install file with package via
low level commands (rpm or dpkg) before use hi level commands (yum, apt).

Just try your comfort style for package management and save your experience the same
on any platform. EEPM will print out any real command it uses so you can learn from it.

Also EEPM has initial support for control repositories: list, add, remove, update

Pay attention to follow useful commands:
epmqf - query package(s) owning file
epmqp - search in the list of installed packages

epmqf helps get package name for any file or command in the system:
$ epmqf epmqf
Note: epmqf is placed as /usr/bin/epmqf
 $ rpm -qf /usr/bin/epmqf
eepm-1.1.0-alt2
Note: /usr/bin/epmqf is link to epm
Note: epm is placed as /usr/bin/epm
 $ rpm -qf /usr/bin/epm
eepm-1.1.0-alt2
